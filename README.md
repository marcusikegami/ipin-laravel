## Description

Patent Manager is a web application that serves as a portfolio for the patent lifecycle from application to expiration. This Application's client is built with Vite (React(JS\*)) and the server with Laravel.

## Installation

-   NPM, PHP(8.x), and COMPOSER are required for this project. Navigate to the desired directory and clone the git repo. Next from the base directory run `composer install`. You can run `php artisan serve` to see if Laravel was installed correctly. Next navigate to the client directory and run `npm install`. After that completes run `npm run dev` to see if the client-side depencies installed correctly. From there you can navigate to "http://localhost:3000" in the browser to see the application.

## Usage

This software is intended to be used to manage patents throughout their lifecycle
