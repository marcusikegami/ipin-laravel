                            Rick Ikegami received his Bachelor’s in Science from
                            the University of Utah and continued on to obtain
                            his MBA from Westminster College with a focus on
                            Health Care Marketing. Serving as an expert in
                            business development with a keen understanding of
                            the health care market here in Utah, Rick has spent
                            the last 32 years of his career helping health care
                            professionals grow their business, with the last 15
                            years being dedicated primarily to personal injury.
                            Rick understands the nuances of personal injury and
                            has made it a personal goal to improve the
                            experiences of both patient and provider. Rick
                            started IPIN with the understanding that there was a
                            need for under-privileged patients, involved in
                            personal injury cases, to receive the treatment that
                            they otherwise would not be able to afford. Rick
                            loves to spend time with his four children, Ashley,
                            Kobe, Marcus, and Maya. As a family they love the
                            outdoors, Utah Utes football, the Utah Jazz,
                            golfing, and bowling. Rick also has a taste for art
                            and watches and likes to look for new additions to
                            his collections.
